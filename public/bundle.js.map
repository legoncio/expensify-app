It contains class and instance methods for creating, parsing, interrogating, transforming, and formatting them.\n *\n * A DateTime comprises of:\n * * A timestamp. Each DateTime instance refers to a specific millisecond of the Unix epoch.\n * * A time zone. Each instance is considered in the context of a specific zone (by default the local system's zone).\n * * Configuration properties that effect how output strings are formatted, such as `locale`, `numberingSystem`, and `outputCalendar`.\n *\n * Here is a brief overview of the most commonly used functionality it provides:\n *\n * * **Creation**: To create a DateTime from its components, use one of its factory class methods: {@link local}, {@link utc}, and (most flexibly) {@link fromObject}. To create one from a standard string format, use {@link fromISO}, {@link fromHTTP}, and {@link fromRFC2822}. To create one from a custom string format, use {@link fromFormat}. To create one from a native JS date, use {@link fromJSDate}.\n * * **Gregorian calendar and time**: To examine the Gregorian properties of a DateTime individually (i.e as opposed to collectively through {@link toObject}), use the {@link year}, {@link month},\n * {@link day}, {@link hour}, {@link minute}, {@link second}, {@link millisecond} accessors.\n * * **Week calendar**: For ISO week calendar attributes, see the {@link weekYear}, {@link weekNumber}, and {@link weekday} accessors.\n * * **Configuration** See the {@link locale} and {@link numberingSystem} accessors.\n * * **Transformation**: To transform the DateTime into other DateTimes, use {@link set}, {@link reconfigure}, {@link setZone}, {@link setLocale}, {@link plus}, {@link minus}, {@link endOf}, {@link startOf}, {@link toUTC}, and {@link toLocal}.\n * * **Output**: To convert the DateTime to other representations, use the {@link toRelative}, {@link toRelativeCalendar}, {@link toJSON}, {@link toISO}, {@link toHTTP}, {@link toObject}, {@link toRFC2822}, {@link toString}, {@link toLocaleString}, {@link toFormat}, {@link toMillis} and {@link toJSDate}.\n *\n * There's plenty others documented below. In addition, for more information on subtler topics like internationalization, time zones, alternative calendars, validity, and so on, see the external documentation.\n */\n\n\nvar DateTime = /*#__PURE__*/function () {\n  /**\n   * @access private\n   */\n  function DateTime(config) {\n    var zone = config.zone || Settings.defaultZone;\n    var invalid = config.invalid || (Number.isNaN(config.ts) ? new Invalid(\"invalid input\") : null) || (!zone.isValid ? unsupportedZone(zone) : null);\n    /**\n     * @access private\n     */\n\n    this.ts = isUndefined(config.ts) ?
